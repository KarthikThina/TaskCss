    <h1 Class="title">Autonomous vehicles (AVs)</h1>
            
    <p class="indent"><span class="firstCaps">A</span> vehicles (AVs), also known as self-driving cars, are one of the most transformative technologies on the horizon. These vehicles use a combination of sensors, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and sophisticated algorithms to navigate and operate without human intervention. Here’s a closer look at autonomous vehicles and their potential impact:</p>

   <h2>How Autonomous Vehicles Work</h2>    
<p>Autonomous vehicles rely on a range of technologies to operate safely and efficiently:</p>
    
    <p><b>Sensors and Cameras:</b> AVs use LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), radar, and cameras to detect objects, map the environment, and identify obstacles. These sensors provide a 360-degree view of the vehicle’s surroundings.</p>
    <p><b>AI and Machine Learning: </b>AI algorithms analyze data from sensors in real time to make decisions about speed, direction, and obstacle avoidance. Machine learning allows the vehicle to improve its driving abilities over time.</p>
    <p>GPS and Mapping: High-precision GPS systems combined with detailed maps help the vehicle navigate its environment, plan routes, and predict traffic patterns.</p>
    <p>Connectivity: Vehicles communicate with each other and infrastructure (V2V and V2I) to share information about road conditions, traffic, and hazards.</p>
    
    <h3>Levels of Autonomy</h3>
    <p class="noindent">Autonomous vehicles are classified into levels based on how much human intervention is required:</p>
    
    <p class="noindent">Level 0: No automation (driver is fully in control).</p>
    <p class="noindent">Level 1: Driver assistance, such as adaptive cruise control.</p>
    <p class="noindent">Level 2: Partial automation, where the vehicle can handle some tasks, like steering and acceleration, but the driver must remain engaged.</p>
    <p class="noindent">Level 3: Conditional automation, where the vehicle can handle most tasks, but the driver must be ready to take control if necessary.</p>
    <p class="noindent">Level 4: High automation, where the vehicle can drive autonomously in specific environments (e.g., within a geo-fenced area like a city).</p>
    <p class="noindent">Level 5: Full automation, where the vehicle can operate autonomously under any conditions, with no need for a driver.</p>
    <h3>Potential Benefits of Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
    <p class="noindent">Safety Improvements: AVs have the potential to dramatically reduce traffic accidents, as human error accounts for 90% of accidents. With AI-driven systems, autonomous vehicles can react faster than humans, avoid collisions, and follow traffic</p>
